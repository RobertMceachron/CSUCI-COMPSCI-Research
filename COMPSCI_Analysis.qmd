## Demographic Exploration

### Gender

Computer science programs have historically under-represented women and non-binary populations. This same relationship can be seen from the data from Channel Islands. Due to the small sample size of non-binary (*n* = 1), their value was re-coded as being female for future analyses.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
  ggplot(data = ddata,
        mapping = aes(x = fct_infreq(Gender), fill = Gender)) + 
        geom_bar() +
        scale_fill_manual(values= c("#E798A1","#A90806","#A90806","#E798A1"), guide="none") +
        labs(x = "Gender",
             y = "Number of Students") + 
        geom_text(stat = 'count', aes(label = ..count..), vjust = -0.5)
```

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
mdata <- ddata[ddata$Gender_Binary == 0, ]
fdata <- ddata[ddata$Gender_Binary == 1, ]
```

It was found that both males and females stay at Channel Islands roughly the same amount of terms with males staying 5.11 terms and females staying 5.59 terms on average. A t-test determined a non-significant difference between the two groups (*p* \> .05).

```{r}
#| message: false
#| eval: false
#| warning: false
mean(mdata$Terms_Attended) # Male Terms Mean
mean(fdata$Terms_Attended) # Female Terms Mean
t.test(mdata$Terms_Attended, fdata$Terms_Attended, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)
```

Graduation rates were found to be non-significantly different (*p* \> .05), with males graduating 44.76% of the time and females 42.24% of the time across all terms.

```{r}
#| eval: false
mean(mdata$Did_Graduate_All) # Male Graduation Mean
mean(fdata$Did_Graduate_All) # Female Graduation Mean
t.test(mdata$Did_Graduate_All, fdata$Did_Graduate_All, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)
```

### Hispanic Status

Due to Channel Islands being a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), exploration of student's Hispanic Status was important to us. The following chart showcases the makeup of Hispanic and Non-Hispanic student's in the Computer Science Department.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
# Hispanic Plot
  dfhis <- as.factor(ddata$Is_Hispanic) # Converts to readable format for ggplot
  dfhis <- as.data.frame(dfhis)
  ggplot(data = dfhis,
        mapping = aes(x = dfhis, fill = dfhis)) + 
        geom_bar() +
        labs(x = "Hispanic Staus",
             y = "Number of Students") +
        scale_fill_manual(values= c("#A90806","#E798A1"), guide="none") +
        geom_text(stat = 'count', aes(label = after_stat(count)), vjust = -0.5) +
        scale_x_discrete(labels=c("Non-Hispanic", "Hispanic"))
```

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
nhisdata <- ddata[ddata$Is_Hispanic == 0, ]
hisdata <- ddata[ddata$Is_Hispanic == 1, ]
```

Student's from both identity statuses attended same amount of terms (*Winter, Fall, Spring, Summer*) with non-Hispanic students attending a mean of 5.638 terms and Hispanic students 5.370. A two sided t-test determined no significant difference between the two groups (*p* \> .05).

```{r}
#| eval: false
mean(nhisdata$Terms_Attended) # Non-Hispanic Terms Mean
mean(hisdata$Terms_Attended) # Hispanic Terms Mean
t.test(hisdata$Terms_Attended, nhisdata$Terms_Attended, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)
```

Hispanic student's were found to graduate 37.5% of the time, whereas their Non-Hispanic counterparts graduated 49.3% of the time. Further examination revealed a significant difference in graduation rate among the two groups, *t*(1449)= 4.73, *p* \< .001.

```{r}
#| eval: false    
summary(nhisdata$Did_Graduate_All) # Non-Hispanic Graduation Mean
summary(hisdata$Did_Graduate_All) # Hispanic Graduation Mean
t.test(nhisdata$Did_Graduate_All, hisdata$Did_Graduate_All, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)
```

The intersection of the aforementioned findings indicate that Hispanic and Non-Hispanic students attend the same amount of terms, but Hispanic students graduate at a significantly lower rate.

### Transfer Status

Channel Islands receives lots of transfer student's due to programs in place at the local community colleges and the institutions relatively low cost. This is supported by the data we received below.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
# Transfer Plot
  dftrans <- as.factor(ddata$Is_Transfer) # Converts to readable format for ggplot
  dftrans <- as.data.frame(dftrans)
  ggplot(data = dftrans,
        mapping = aes(x = fct_infreq(dftrans), fill = dftrans, group = dftrans)) +
        geom_bar() +
        labs(x = "Transfer Status",
             y = "Number of Students") +
        scale_fill_manual(values= c("#E798A1","#A90806"), guide="none") +
        scale_x_discrete(labels=c("Non-Transfer","Transfer")) +
        geom_text(stat = 'count', aes(label = ..count..), vjust = -0.5)
```

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
hdata <- ddata[ddata$Is_Transfer == 0, ]
tdata <- ddata[ddata$Is_Transfer == 1, ]
```

It was found that student's who started their academic journey at Channel Islands attend more terms (*M* = 5.96) as those who transfer (*M* = 5.15) with a significant difference, *t*(1282) = 4.957, *p* \< .001. Interestingly, this difference was not as large as expected as those who transfer should theoretically need far less classes then those who start at the institution.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| eval: false
summary(hdata$Terms_Attended) # Home Terms Mean
summary(tdata$Terms_Attended) # Transfer Terms Mean
t.test(tdata$Terms_Attended, hdata$Terms_Attended, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)
```

When taking into account graduation rates, the lack of disparity between terms attended for transfer and non-transfer student becomes apparent. Student's who started at Channel Islands graduate 35.61% of the time whereas those who transfer graduate 51.98% of the time. A t-test determined that this was a significant difference, *t*(1552) = 6.61, *p* \> .001.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
summary(hdata$Did_Graduate_All) # Home Graduation Mean
summary(tdata$Did_Graduate_All) # Transfer Graduation Mean
t.test(tdata$Did_Graduate_All, hdata$Did_Graduate_All, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)
```

### Majors

The Computer Science Department at Channel Islands includes the majors of Computer Science, Mechatronics and Information Technology. Due to some student's double majoring or changing programs the data includes majors that are outside this category.

Our major count was:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
dfmajor <- as.data.frame(c(ddata$major1_Descr, ddata$major2_Descr, ddata$major3_Descr)) # Combines student's majors into a DF
dfmajor <- dfmajor %>% # Removes NA Values
            na.omit(mutate(dfmajor = str_trim(c(ddata$major1, ddata$major2, ddata$major3))))
colnames(dfmajor) <- c("Major") # Renames Column
dfmajor <- dfmajor %>% # Creates count of majors
            count(Major)
print(dfmajor)
dfmajor <- dfmajor[dfmajor$n > 20, ] # Removes major with under 20 students
```

Due to the small sample size, majors with under 20 student's were excluded for the following chart:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
ggplot(data = dfmajor,
        mapping = aes(x = Major, y = n, fill = Major, group = Major)) + 
        geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
        scale_fill_manual(values= c("#A90806","#E798A1", "#A90806","#E798A1"), guide="none") +
        geom_text(stat = "Identity", aes(label = n), vjust = -0.5) + 
        labs(y = "Number of Students")
```

### Gender and Hispanic Status

It was found that Hispanic males graduate **39.44%** of the time, whereas their Non-Hispanic male counterparts graduate **48.54%** of the time. Similarly, Hispanic females graduate **29.13%** of the time and Non-Hispanic females graduate **53.33%** of the time. This showcases a large disparity between Hispanic and Non-Hispanic students. In addition, there is a **\~10%** difference in graduation rates among Hispanic males and females, whereas this disparity is not seen in their Non-Hispanic counterparts.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
  mhisdata <- mdata[mdata$Is_Hispanic == 1, ] # Male Hispanic 
  fhisdata <- fdata[fdata$Is_Hispanic == 1, ] # Female Hispanic
  
  mnhisdata <- mdata[mdata$Is_Hispanic == 0, ] # Male Not Hispanic
  fnhisdata <- fdata[fdata$Is_Hispanic == 0, ] # Female Not Hispanic
  
  # Gender by Hispanic Status
    summary(mhisdata$Did_Graduate_All) # Male Hispanic 0.3944
    summary(fhisdata$Did_Graduate_All) # Female Hispanic 0.2913
    
    summary(mnhisdata$Did_Graduate_All) # Male Not Hispanic: 0.4854
    summary(fnhisdata$Did_Graduate_All) # Female Not Hispanic: 0.5333
```
